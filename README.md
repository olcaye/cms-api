https://adonisjs.com/


Available endpoints;

/api/client/login
/api/client/register
/api/client/logout

/api/client/
/api/client/delete
/api/client/update


/api/customers/login
/api/customers/register

/api/customers/{id}
/api/customers/{id}/delete


Notes;

Register with /api/client/register, then login with /api/client/login

That endpoint returns bearer token. That token can be used for auth.

Also postman collection there;
